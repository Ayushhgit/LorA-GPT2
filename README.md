# ðŸš€ LoRA Fine-Tuning with Hugging Face Transformers

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-2) using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** with the Hugging Face `peft` library. It also includes an inference pipeline to generate meaningful text outputs after training.

## ðŸ“š What is LoRA?

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that **injects trainable low-rank matrices** into existing models. Instead of updating all model weights, LoRA modifies only a small set of adapter weightsâ€”making training **faster, cheaper, and easier**.
